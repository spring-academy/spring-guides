Spring Boot 3.2 [describes many new features](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.2-Release-Notes). We are particularly excited about a few specific features:

- [`RestClient`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.2-Release-Notes#restclient-support)
- [`JdbcClient`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.2-Release-Notes#support-for-jdbcclient)
- [Virtual Threads](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.2-Release-Notes#support-for-virtual-threads)

You can get the chance to work hands-on with these new Spring Boot 3.2 features. You can experiment entirely in the browser, and no changes are made to your local machine.
