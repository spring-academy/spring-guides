This guide provides a sampling of how [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) helps you accelerate application development. As you read more Spring Getting Started guides, you will see more use cases for Spring Boot. This guide is meant to give you a quick taste of Spring Boot. If you want to create your own Spring Boot-based project, use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), fill in your project details, pick your options, and download a bundled up project as a zip file.

You will build a simple web application with Spring Boot and add some useful services to it.
