This guide lets you experience how easy it is to deploy and run
a Spring application on a Cloud Platform running
Tanzu Application Platform (TAP).

You will:

- Create a new Spring application using a platform provide template
- Run it on the Cloud Platform
- Make changes to the app
- Re-deploy the app to the Cloud Platform using Live-Update

Thanks to TAP and its IDE extensions,
there’s no need to write complex Docker and YAML files.
You’ll get to experience a new way to get from code to an URL
in a Kubernetes-based Cloud Platform in no time.
The best part? No Docker or Kubernetes experience is needed!
