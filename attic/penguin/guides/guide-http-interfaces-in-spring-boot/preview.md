In this guide, you will follow along with [Dan Vega’s YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR580OCEp7w) on how to use HttpInterfaces with the recently introduced RestClient.

You will follow Dan’s video and write the same code as he does. While this lab could be completed as a standalone exercise, it is recommended that you work in this lab in conjunction with watching Dan’s video.
