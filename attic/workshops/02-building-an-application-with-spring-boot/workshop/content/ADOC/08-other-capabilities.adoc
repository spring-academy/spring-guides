== View Spring Boot's Starters

You have seen some of
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter[Spring Boot's "`starters`"].
You can see them all
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/main/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters[here in source code].

== JAR Support

The last example showed how Spring Boot lets you wire beans that you may not be aware you
need. It also showed how to turn on convenient management services.

However, Spring Boot does more than that. It supports not only traditional WAR file
deployments but also lets you put together executable JARs, thanks to Spring Boot's loader
module. The various guides demonstrate this dual support through the
`spring-boot-gradle-plugin`.
