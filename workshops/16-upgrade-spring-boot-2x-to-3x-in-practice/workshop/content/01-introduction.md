Remeber the PAUTR and SCAR principles!

### PAUTR

- `Prepare` - review the release notes, plan the migration path
- `Assess` - establish a baseline - Known Good State (`KGS`)
- `Update`
  - Base Spring Boot dependency
  - Spring / Spring Boot dependencies
  - Non-Spring managed dependencies as required
- `Test`

  - Update test dependencies
  - Execute tests
  - Run the application and test for parity

- `Release` - ship it!

### SCAR

- `Small change` - make a small change
- `Compile` - attempt to compile
- `Assess` - what's the impact of the change
- `React` - fix and cleanup

Rinse and Repeat
