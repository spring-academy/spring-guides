The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the reader to two tools that can remove much of the toil from upgrading applications.

The first of these is Open Rewrite, an open source tool with thousands of recipes and a build-tool based operating model.

The second is the experimental Spring Boot Migrator, which while based on Open Rewrite has a much different operating model.

For this workshop we will use the Cash Card Application, running on Java 8 and Spring Boot 2.7 in its current iteration. Our first focus is upgrading the JVM from 8 to 17 before upgrading the Spring Boot version to 3.0.
